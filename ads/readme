ads and related files go here.
To add a new company, create the directory here and then add it to the pao.cfg.
Other files needed for a new add/company:
/ads/
    /YourCompanyNameHere/
                        Config.txt   / this file contains the number of ads you want it to pick from
                        0.txt        / this is a test file, with the short text message for the ad you want read. KEEP IT SHORT!
                        0.png        / this is the "ad" image that will be shown while your ad is read.
                        1.txt        / this is the 2nd ad text, so add 2.txt,3.txt etc.
                        1.png        / the 2nd add image... so add 2.png, 3.png for more ads!
                        logo.png     / the logo for your company. Will be used as an overlay and in other places!
